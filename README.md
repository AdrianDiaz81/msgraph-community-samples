# Microsoft Graph Community Samples & Tutorials

This repository contains samples & tutorials that demonstrate different usage patterns for the Microsoft Graph API.

## Have issues or questions?

Please do not open GitHub issues for general support questions as the GitHub list should be used for feature requests and bug reports. This way we can more easily track actual issues or bugs from the code and keep the general discussion separate from the actual code.

If you have questions / issues with samples in this repository, use the [issues](/microsoftgraph/community-samples/issues) list.

Clone this repository by executing the following command in your console:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoftgraph/community-samples.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository folder which should be the same as the repository name:

```

To access the samples use the following command, where you replace `sample-folder-name` with the name of the sample you want to access.

Follow the instructions within each sample's `README.md` for how to get the sample working. This repository contains many different types of projects & technologies as well as pre-requisites so each could have a different process to get working.
