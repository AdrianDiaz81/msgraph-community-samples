# Microsoft Graph Tutorials

Tutorials around the Microsoft Graph API to demonstrate different capabilities and possibilities with the API. Each tutorial has it's own dedicated readme file to explain setup instructions and demonstrated capability.

Since tutorials are build one-by-one to demonstrate the different capabilities, they are split with multiple folders demonstrating different stages of the tutorial progress.
